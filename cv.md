	 Amanda Palmer is an American musician who tours a lot, and has a tenency to do free concerts here and there with short notice given on Twitter. I created a tool to watch her twitter and send out an email alert when she mentions a chosen town, so that people who sign up for the service will know if she is thinking of coming to their area.
